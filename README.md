# 📘 DSA in C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice in C++**.  
The problems are organized into different folders based on categories such as arrays, strings, searching, sorting, etc.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **BASIC/** → Basic C++ programs and fundamental concepts.  
- **LEETCODE-CODING NINJAS/** → Solutions to problems from LeetCode and Coding Ninjas.  
- **ARRAY PROGRAMS/** → Problems related to arrays.  
- **STRING PROGRAMS/** → String-related problems.  
- **SEARCHING PROGRAMS/** → Searching algorithms and problems.  
- **SORTING PROGRAMS/** → Sorting algorithms and problems.  
- **NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERSION/** → Programs related to number systems (binary, decimal, etc.).  
- **PATTERN PRINTING/** → C++ programs for various pattern problems.

## 📝 Naming Convention

- Files that start with a **number** (e.g., `54_Spiral_Matrix.cpp`) represent the **LeetCode problem number**.  
  - Example: `54_Spiral_Matrix.cpp` → Solution to **LeetCode Problem #54 (Spiral Matrix)**.  

- Files that start with a **CN** (e.g., `CN_Binary_Search.cpp`) represent the **Coding Ninjas Platform Problem**.  
  - Example: `CN_Binary_Search.cpp` → Solution to **Coding Ninjas Platform Problem Name - Binary Search**.  

- Other files without numbers represent **Coding Ninjas Platform Problems Solution or practice codes**.  
  - Example: `Sum_of_Two_Arrays.cpp` → A custom array problem solution.
